# budgetManager
Budget Manager with MERN stack. 

Using Express.js, React and MongoDB to create a Budget Manager for users to track MTD and YTD expenses with login authentication, password hashing, and jwt-token. 

My vision for this project is that a user can view the website and be able to create a quick budget without having to login in or create an account. If they do decide to "sign up", they will have access to a dashboard that will allow them to enter in expenses on a monthly basis and have it be saved the MongoDB to render MTD budgets they can access as well as an "overview" for their YTD expenses based off of their budgets logged.
